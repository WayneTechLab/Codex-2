# Codex-2

This repository contains a small Node.js application that displays crypto news from several RSS feeds. The app offers a home page, about page, contact page and a news page where you can filter by crypto category and news source.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the web app:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. If a feed cannot be retrieved (for example due to network restrictions), the app prints a warning and continues.
